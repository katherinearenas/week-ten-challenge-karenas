# week-ten-challenge-karenas
Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to allow a user to create an SVG logo, using node.js, inquirer, and jest. 

Functionality:

Users can input answers to questions asked through the command line. The user can submit a 3 character text and choose between a circle square and triangle. The user can select a text color, and a background color, using hexidecimal code or plain language as their responses.

Goals Accomplished:

Users are able to create an SVG logo with the commmand line using inquirer prompts.

Notes:

I refactored code from class materials and had my instructor and had a tutor help me debug.

This project is deployed using gitHub pages at https://katherinearenas.github.io/week-ten-challenge-karenas/
